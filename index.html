				<h3>The Narrative</h3>
				<h1 class="header__title">Documentary</h1>
				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">This story takes place at 3,300m above sea level. Maras salt mine is an accumulation of more than 4,000 salt pools located high up in the vast
Andes mountain range, 60 km from Cusco, Peru. Here, indigenous people have been
collecting salt by hand for more than 600 years, before the Inca times. Today, the salt workers of Maras are owners of these “salt pools”, however, this wasn’t
always like this.</p>

				<h2>Historical reference</h2>
				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">In the ’80s and 90’s the Peruvian government used to own Maras Salt Mines under a
government company called EMSAL. During these years, the salt workers suffered unfair
working conditions and wages for years and years. These decades were nothing but a
struggle for the communities surrounding Maras Salt Mine, (Maras, Pichingoto and Moray)
After weeks of protest demanding the government better working conditions, the salt
production of Maras was handed to the municipality of Maras, in DEcember 1981. However,
things didn’t change substantially.</p>

				<h2>"Our documentary explores through Mrs. Laurita’s eyes"</h2>
				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">
After years of continued struggle, in 1997, the workers got the recognition of their ownership of the salt pools and today they proudly own and operate all of the salt production of Maras under a communal company founded by themselves called “Marasal”. There are more than 1,000 indigenous families in Maras that depend on salt production to make a living. The salt pools are inherited within the workers’ families, passing these land and knowledge generation after generation. It wasn’t until recent years after tourism boomed
in the Sacred Valley of the Incas (Cusco to Machu Picchu) that the salt workers of Maras
started to generate a living income for them and their families.</p>

Today, the artisanal salt
extraction has become not only a substantial source of income but a tradition that keeps
being passed generation after generation. Our documentary explores through Mrs. Laurita’s eyes, a 65-year-old salt worker, the
historical and cultural meaning that Maras Salt Mines has for her and her community and
how this well-preserved tradition is shaping the next generation of indigenous people in the

				<h2>The salt Process</h2>
				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">“This salt is like a vitamin, it has no disease,” Says Mrs. Laurita.
Maras Salt comes from an underground creek from the mountain nearby. The salty water
contained in these mountains runs and gets deposited in these “pools”, that have been built
by the indigenous salt workers.
After approximately 3 days and due to the heat from the sun, the water evaporates and
leaves just salt, ready to be collected.</p>

				<h2>“This salt is like a vitamin, it has no disease”</h2>
				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">The salt is later on collected by the salt workers and put into 50kg bags. In Maras Salt
Mines, usually men carry these heavy loads on their shoulders, up and down the narrow
paths between the salt pools, so they can put them into different storage units called “Eras”.
Some workers start as early as 4 am, all the way until the sun goes down.
The salt is later dried, packed, and transported to the local, national and in recent years,
international markets.
As Mrs. Laurita mentions in the film, this salt has no chemicals and it’s as pure as it gets.
Similar to Himalayan rock salt, this salt has no “Mining” process and it remains as one of the
only rock salt productions in the world to remain completely free of mining.</p>

				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">People start working at the salt mines from an early age. Mrs. Laurita has been working
since she was 13 years old, and she has not stopped since.
As mentioned above, during a normal workday, they collect the salt in 50kg bags, which are
usually carried by the man, however, the collecting process is done by both men and
women. Most of the salt workers come from the nearby communities of Pichingoto, Maras and
Moray. Many of them walk the 4km mountain trek from Maras, however, some either take
the transportation arranged by Marasal (Trucks) or some have their transportation as
motorcycles.</p>

					<p class="intro-p">An interesting note is that different hats represent different communities in the region. For example, the length of Mrs. Laurita’s hat in the film is representative of the community of
Maras. It is very normal during the day, that the workers will have a break and drink “Chicha” which
is a traditional drink made out of potatoes. This keeps them energized and going through the
hard and hot day of work.</p>

				<h2>Pachamama</h2>

During our interviews with different salt workers, the conscious way of thinking is very much
present in their everyday life and most of them respect mother nature in everything they do.
During their daily life, but especially during August, they make offerings to Pachamama to
bring better harvests, better weather and anything that mother nature can provide them with.
Sometimes an offering to Pachamama can be as simple as pouring someone’s drink into the
ground or bigger offerings such as burying pots with fully cooked food, next to coca leaves,
wines and traditional drinks.</p>

				<div class="info">
					<p class="intro-p">“We would like to keep our cultures and traditions”
Since the salt workers of Maras became owners of the salt pools, and years later managed
to open for tourism, their quality of life has significantly improved. “Today we can send our
kids to schools, to universities,” says Mrs. Laurita.

With their income, the future generations don’t fully depend on the salt mines to make a
living. The new generation of Maras can go to school and get educated. Many of them will
go to bigger cities and some of them will stay. One thing is for sure, they will not be exploited
the way their parents or grandparents were back in the days. Will this be one of the last
generations working the salt mines? Things will keep changing and evolving at Maras Salt
Pools, and some traditions might stay, some might get lost along the way.</p>

					<p class="intro-p">The people of Maras fought for many years for what they have, and this land belongs to
them and their future generations.
Our project and short film is a testament to who the Maras Salt Workers are today, where
they come from and what is the future holding for them. It is our way of honouring their
constant hard work for keeping their traditions alive, something that is harder and harder to
find in the fast-changing world we live in.
We are forever grateful for letting us tell their story and for touching our lives in such
profound ways.
